# 3D-Particle-Transformator.

*This project aims to simulate a self assembling effect applied on a 3D drone model.*

## Insights.

- Implemented Drone with SceneKit.
- SCNAction for rotation motion in 3D object.
- Used CoreAnimations and CoreGraphics for animations.
- CADisplayLink to animate counting animation in battery percentage.
- Dynamic Autolayout to support all size classes.
- Tessellation and Subdivision to enhance 3d model.
- Voxelization with Model I/O for particle division of drone.
- Vortex field and physics to execute transformation.
