# 3D-Particle-Transformator.

Created a 3D effect which simulates a 3D model (drone in this instance) transforming itself. 

Insights
• Implemented Drone with SceneKit.
• SCNAction for rotation motion in 3D object.
• Used CoreAnimations and CoreGraphics for animations.
• CADisplayLink to animate counting animation in battery percentage. 
• Dynamic Autolayout to support all size classes.
• Tessellation and Subdivision to enhance 3d model. 
• Voxelization with Model I/O for particle division of drone.
• Vortex field and physics to execute transformation.
